- 👋 Hi, I’m @ChanceVincent
- 👀 I’m a domestic prisoner to a mentally ill parent in a country where the law allows old people to take prisoners.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning game development with any free resources I can get online in the hope of producing something I can sell to make enough money to buy my freedom from the court.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any opportunity that will make me the money I need to get out of here so I can have a chance at having a life of my own. I am a talented 3D artist doing my best alone to learn game programming with any engine I can make proper use of. There are many engines but few open doors. Stride is the one I am presently most hopeful on.
- 📫 How to reach me ... ikr
